# RaspPy-GC-Control
RaspPi Python GPIO for Germination Chamber Control using Adafruit sensors.

The developmental control board kit was used to understand the seed germinator enclosure via various environmental sensors and enact control via a humidification, ventilation, and hot coil system.
Because of the modular nature of Raspberry Pi and the control board kit, the goal was to be able to try various software/hardware control methods before commiting to a final solution and minimizing the product.
